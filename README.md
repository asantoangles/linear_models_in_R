# Linear Models in R — Workshop Materials

Repository for Linear Models in R, a two-session workshop organized by the Neuroscience Center PhD and Postdoc Council in collaboration with the Biostatistics Unit in November 2025. This repository contains all slides, example code, and hands-on exercises used during the workshop. This workshop combines lecture and hands-on coding to bridge statistical thinking with practical data analysis in R, focusing on how to fit, assess, and interpret linear models in the context of real-world research problems.
